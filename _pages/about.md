I am a fourth-year PhD student in Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University. I work at the [Systems Optimization and Multiscale Analysis group](https://people.tamu.edu/~hasan/people/bio/?name=ashfaq) under the supervision of [Prof. Faruque Hasan](https://engineering.tamu.edu/chemical/profiles/hasan-faruque.html#:~:text=Assistant%20Director%20of%20Decarbonization,%20Texas%20A&M). My research interests are in mathematical modeling, mixed-integer classical-quantum optimization algorithms, process design and optimization, and machine learning. Currently, I am working on the computer-aided molecular design of novel solvent molecules for separating mixed refrigerants with high global warming potential. 

Prior to that, I earned my B.Sc. (2018) and M.Sc. (2020) in Chemical Engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). My M.Sc. research, under [Prof. Shoukat Choudhury](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HCyAZMQAAAAJ#:~:text=Dr.%20M.%20A.%20A.%20Shoukat%20Choudhury.) and [Prof. Rafiqul Gani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zpXSGaIAAAAJ#:~:text=Articles%201%E2%80%9320.%20%E2%80%AAPSE%20for%20SPEED%20Company,), focused on the integrated design and control of reactive distillation processes. 

My CV can be found [here](https://aiftakher.github.io/files/1.1_Ashfaq_CV.pdf). (Update: 10/5/2024)
